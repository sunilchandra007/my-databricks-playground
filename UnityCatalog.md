- It register metadata about tables, volumes, external locations, and shares etc and the permissions that govern access to them.
- Each metastore exposes a three-level namespace (**catalog.schema.table**|view|volume) by which data can be organized.
- Only one metastore is allowed in one region


- Table governs tablular datasets
- Volume add governance over non-tabular datsets including structured, semi-structured and unstructured data
